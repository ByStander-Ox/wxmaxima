- Does test/testbench_simple.wxmx work?
- Enter the new version number into CMakeLists.txt
- Update data/io.github.wxmaxima_developers.wxMaxima.appdata.xml
- Create a git tag for the release
- Go to the releases page Github and convert the tag into a release
- Update the release info on the download page and in release.txt
  in the gh_pages branch.
- Append "-DevelopmentSnapshot" to the version number in CMakeLists.txt for the new development version.
- (Maybe) announce the new version on software news sites like https://freshcode.club/
