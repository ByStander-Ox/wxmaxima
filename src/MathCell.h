  The base class all cell types are derived from

  Every MathCell is part of a double-linked lists: A MathCell does have 
  a member that points to the previous item (or contains a NULL for the head node 
  of the list) and a member that points to the next cell (or contains a NULL if 
  this is the end node of a list).
  Also every list of MathCells can be a branch of a tree since every math cell contains
  a pointer to its parent group cell.

  Besides the cell types that are directly user visible there are cells for several
  kinds of items that are displayed in a special way like abs() statements (displayed
  as horizontal rules), subscripts, superscripts and exponents.
  Another important concept realized realized by a clas derived from this one is 
  the group cell that groups all things that are foldable in the gui like:
   - A combination of maxima input with the output, the input prompt and the output 
     label.
   - A chapter or a section and
   - Images with their title (or the input cells that generated them)
   .

  \attention Derived classes must test if m_next equals NULL and if it doesn't
  they have to delete() it.
