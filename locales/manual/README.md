The Translation of the manual
=============================

### Translating the manual to a new language

In order to translate the manual to a entirely new language it is sufficient to 
equip wxmaxima.md.pot with the translations and to give the resulting file a name in 
the format `<language>.po`.

### Improving an existing translation

In order to improve an existing translation just edit the according .po file.
Any help is always welcome.

### Specialities of the manual

po4any offers to translate the characters that contain the formatting hints 
for the markdown parser, too. If you remove them or exchange them by something
completely different the formatting will change, too.
