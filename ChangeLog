15.08:
  * Compatibility with maxima 5.37.0
  * MathJAX now provides scaleable equations and extended drag-and-drop for the html export.
  * The table-of-contents-sidebar now shows the current cursor position
  * Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping out of the screen
  * Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping to the beginning or end of the worksheet
  * Better detection which cell maxima is processing and if it still is doing so
  * Regression: Hiding the toolbar didn't work on some systems
  * Markdown support for <=, >=, <=>, <-, ->, <->, => and +/- symbols.
  * An option to not export maxima's input as well as the output.
  * An option to use High-resolution bitmaps for the HTML export.
  * Images that are too big for the window now are displayed in a scaled-down version.
  * Fixed the support for out-of-tree-bulds that was broken in 15.04
  * Meaningful ALT texts for the HTML export to provide accessibility
  * An option to include the .wxmx file in the .html export
  * Performance fixes that are espectionally effective for MSW
  * Unification of some platform-specific code
  * bash autocompletion
  * A fourth sectioning level
  * Made entering uppercase greek letters easier and documented how to input special
	unicode symbols
  * Syntax highlighting in code cells
  * Automatic highlighting of text equal to the currrently selected one.
  * A batch mode that pauses evaluation if maxima asks a question.
  * A "halt on error" feature
  * Now evaluation of a new command is only triggered if evaluation of the last
	command has finished. This means that output from maxima is always appended
	to the right cell.
  * Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per cell. Sincewe now send
	maxima's input command-per-command this means a cell with multiple commands is no
	more evaluated faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  * If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new "trigger evaluation"
	menu entry in the maxima menu.
  * On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant that is based on the
	surprisingly powerful autocompletion feature.
  * Ctrl+Tab now launches the autocompletion (or content assistant, if available)
  * Tab and Shift+Tab now indent and unindent regions.
  * Ctrl+Mouse wheel and Ctrl++/- now zoom in and out of the worksheet.
  * Allow Extending selection from part of a single cell to multiple cells.
  * A Autoindent functionality.

15.04.0:
  * wxWidgets 3.0 is now a mandatory requirement
  * Various bugfixes
  * Loads of stability and performance fixes
  * Adjustable framerate for animations
  * A version-control friendly flavour of the wxmx format
  * A mimetype marker at the beginning of wxmx files
  * Better desktop integration
  * An offline manual
  * Autodetection of maxima's working directory on Mac and Windows
  * Use gnuplot_postamble instead of gnuplot_preamble
  * Dropped the hard dependency of TeXinfo
  * Translation updates
  * LaTeX: Use centered dots for multiplications
  * LaTeX: Added an option to select if superscripts should be
    placed above or after subscripts
  * LaTeX: Allow the user to add additional commands to the preamble.
  * Export of animations to pdf (via a pdfTeX file run) and html
  * Now complex conjugates are drawn as overstrike text.
  * bumped the minor version number of .wxmx: overstrike text is
    a new feature and therefore a file containing it cannot be read by
    old wxMaxima versions.
  * An autosave functionality that makes maxima work more like a mobile
    app whose documents are always saved.
  * A table-of-contents pane for faster navigation
  * It is now possible to scroll away from a running evaluation for
    arbitrary lengths of time and to choose to follow the evaluation
    process again.
  * Now TeX scales down images that are obviously too big for the page.
  * An undo for cell deletes and for adding cells.
  * Autocompletion for units from ezUnits
