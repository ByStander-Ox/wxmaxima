Current:
	- wxWidgets 3.0 is now a mandatory requirement
	- Various bugfixes
	- Loads of stability and performance fixes
	- Adjustable framerate for animations
	- A version-control friendly flavour of the wxmx format
	- A mimetype marker at the beginning of wxmx files
	- Better desktop integration
	- An offline manual
	- Autodetection of maxima's working directory on Mac and Windows
	- Use gnuplot_postamble instead of gnuplot_preamble
	- Dropped the hard dependency of TeXinfo
	- Translation updates
	- LaTeX: Use centered dots for multiplications
	- LaTeX: Added an option to select if superscripts should be
	  placed above or after subscripts
	- LaTeX: Allow the user to add additional commands to the preamble.
	- Export of animations to pdf (via a pdfTeX file run) and html
	- Now complex conjugates are drawn as overstrike text.
	- bumped the minor version number of .wxmx: overstrike text is
	  a new feature and therefore a file containing it cannot be read by
	  old wxMaxima versions.
	- An autosave functionality that makes maxima work more like a mobile
	  app whose documents are always saved.
	- A table-of-contents pane for faster navigation
	- It is now possible to scroll away from a running evaluation for
	  arbitrary lengths of time and to choose to follow the evaluation
	  process again.
	- Now TeX scales down images that are obviously too big for the page.
	- An undo for cell deletes and for adding cells.
	- Autocompletion for units from ezUnits
