About the doxygen documentation                         {#mainpage}
===============================

How to get documentation for the code?
--------------------------------------

 - Install [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/),
 - Optionally install [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
   (it generates call graphs, inheritance graphs and caller graphs
   so it really makes the documentation more usable)
 - make sure these two utilities are in the search path of your
   system
   
 - cd into the [Doxygen](../) directory of the [wxMaxima sources](../../) and type:

        make

If your system is set up for compiling code and the project has
already been compiled on the current system (see the file
[INSTALL](../../INSTALL) for details) this should generate a file
named index.html that will redirect to the documentation.

Where to start reading?
-----------------------

This naturally depends on what you want to archieve.
 - The worksheet is mostly handled by the class MathCtrl
 - All the cells that are displayed in the worksheet and all the sub-
   cells that represent individual elements inside one of these cells
   are child objects of MathCell. This object also contains most of
   the logic that allows to connect the individual cells to a list.
 - The undo buffer and the conversion of cells into characters for
   drag-and-drop or saving files are handles by the class EditorCell
 - The menus are generated by wxMaximaFrame and most of the menu actions
   are handled by the class wxMaxima.
One of the most important concepts that are important to know is that
everything that is displayed in 

Naming rules
------------

Keeping the code more or less homogenous increases the readability. In
order to archieve that wxMaxima uses a few naming rules:
 - The names of member variables are prefixed with "m_".
 - The names of member functions (aka methods) are written in CamelCase.
