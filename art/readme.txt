Toolbar icons (in toolbar/ subdirectory) and the config icons (in
config/ subdirectory) are from the Tango project
(http://tango.freedesktop.org). They origninally were released under
the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) but since then have
been released to the public domain.
They were renamed to match the names of the gtk system icons they
replace.


wxMaxima icons (wxmac.icns, maximaicon.ico, wxmaxima.png) were created
by Sven Hodapp (http://4pple.de) and are under GPL.
wxmaxima.svg was an attempt to make a scaleable vector image that
resembles these icons by Gunter KÃ¶nigsmann (http://www.physikbuch.de)
and is under GPL, too.
